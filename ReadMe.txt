Management Memory Simulator
A C++ Project

-----------------------------------------

How to run on LINUX:
- Open the terminal

- Navigate to the directory. 
    For example, cd /path/to/your/code

- Compile the code using g++. This will generate an executible file. main.cpp will represent the main program.
    For example: g++ -o memorymanagementsimulator main.cpp

- Once you have compiled the code, run the program using the command:
    ./memorymanagementsimulator

- Then, the prompt will ask you to enter paramaters like total memory size, page size, and input file name. 
    Input file name is: in1.txt

- All data outputted will be outputted to their respective output files and NOT the terminal, known as out1.txt, out2.txt, and out3.txt
